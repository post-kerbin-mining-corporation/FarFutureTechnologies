INSTALLATION
============

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

I highly recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), without this you will have problems with balance
